# MyNavigation
Project to study Android Navigation


This project is for study Android Navigation.

we are reproducing the following problem:

We have the MainFragment that can be navigated for FragmentA and FragmentB.

FragmentA and FragmentB can navigate do FragmentC.

FragmentA can navigate to FragmentC directly.

We need that FragmentB uses global action to access the FragmentC.

We can't repeat the Fragments in navigations because can throw a compile error.

The solution for these problems will be in the branches solution_* with a description in the README,

solution_1
solution_2
....
